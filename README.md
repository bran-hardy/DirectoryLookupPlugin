![Near Vanilla Logo](https://github.com/bran-hardy/DirectoryLookupPlugin/blob/master/src/main/resources/icon.png)

The Directory Lookup Plugin is a custom plugin designed for the NearVanilla Minecraft server. It connects directly to the serverâ€™s Notion database, giving players up-to-date information on shops and their inventories.

### How to Use:
Type `/shop [item]` in-game to get a list of shops selling the specified item along with their location at spawn. This plugin makes it easy for players to find the resources they need quickly without taking them away from the minecraft server.
